# hello-world
Just getting going on github
I'm a hobbyist with the Raspberry Pi and Arduino, just barely getting started. As a first step, I want to get my Pi to download GPS information. I have an "RPI GPS Add-on V2.0" that I bought a while back, and it came with zero documentation. I've been hunting to find out how to make it work.
